Spectrum Engine
============

Simple game development engine/framework built on SFML 2.

Currently 'in progress'. 
Linux compilation not yet tested, though intended.

Has some known unresolved dependencies:
*MIOLib* - Personal IO library
*GME* - Game Music Emulator 0.5.2

In future commits, these will be added to the repository.
